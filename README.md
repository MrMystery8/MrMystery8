# Ayaan Minhas (MrMystery8)

AI-focused Computer Science student (BSc, Artificial Intelligence) at Asia Pacific University (APU), Kuala Lumpur.  
I build practical AI systems: LLM/RAG assistants, on-device inference apps, and ML pipelines that ship.

## Focus areas
- LLM/RAG assistants for education and enterprise knowledge bases
- On-device AI (Android / Flutter + native integration)
- TTS + audio provenance (watermarking / attribution experiments)
- Applied ML (risk prediction, evaluation, deployment)

## Featured projects
- **89th Parallel LMS + AI Assistant**  
  Enterprise-style learning platform with AI-powered study support.

  (If you prefer, link the app stores here instead of a deep URL.)

- **Minhas LMS (RAG Learning Platform)**  
  Deployed learning platform + Computer Science AI assistant.

- **TTS Hub (Unified Audio Generation Platform)**  
  One hub to run/manage multiple Apple Silicon–optimized TTS & voice-cloning stacks; includes an audio provenance/watermarking direction and classifier workflow.  
  Repo: https://github.com/MrMystery8/tts-hub

- **Voice Note Summarizer (On-device AI)**  
  Flutter Android app that runs summarization locally with a native Kotlin backend (offline-first, queued processing, share-to-app flows).  
  Repo: https://github.com/MrMystery8/vm_summ

- **Injury Risk Prediction (ML pipeline)** *(optional but strong)*  
  End-to-end modeling + evaluation pipeline for predicting player injury risk with reproducible experiments and dashboards.  
  Repo: https://github.com/MrMystery8/injury_prediction

## Experience (recent)
- **Software Engineer Intern — JurisTech** (Kuala Lumpur, Hybrid)  
  Worked on enterprise software deliverables and production-facing engineering tasks.

- **R&D Assistant — APU Centre for Technology & Innovation** (Kuala Lumpur)  
  Built and tested AI prototypes (LLM/RAG, automation, applied research work).

- **Teaching Assistant — Nixor College** (part-time)  
- **Database Architect Intern — Nixor Creative Studios**

## Skills
- **Languages:** Python, Java/Kotlin, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, SQL
- **App/Web:** Flask, React, Flutter, Three.js
- **AI/ML:** RAG pipelines, embedding retrieval, evaluation, model integration, classical ML workflows
- **Infra:** Linux, deployment basics, version control (Git)

## Education
**BSc Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)** — Asia Pacific University (APU/APIIT)  
Expected: 2026

## Certifications
- **AI Agents Fundamentals** — Hugging Face (Mar 2025)
- **AI X-Perience Workshop** — United Latino Students Association (Feb 2025)
